Oil Enhancement Proposals
-------------------------

Explaining changes to a programming language in prose is a good thing.  Making
your rationale and intentions explicit improves the design.

We're borrowing the process from Python:

<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>

This applies to both the OSH language and the Oil language.  The Oil language
is starting as a backward-compatible enhancement to OSH.

Auto-translation is no longer the primary concern.

### Initial Group of People For Collecting Feedback

- Anyone who's submitted a patch to Oil (the oilshell/oil repo)
- Anyone who's submitted a high-quality bug report
- Anyone already on Zulip (because they're interested.  It's OK if they don't
  know shell very well.)
- Anyone with a public repo of 500+ lines of shell
  - asdf author
  - shell-script-library
- /r/ProgrammingLanguages designers, especially those who use shell.

Note on the philosophy: This list is a hint that I don't consider the opinion
of random passers-by as much as those who have contributed to the project.

Language design isn't a democracy!

However, I do want opinions from non-shell experts.
