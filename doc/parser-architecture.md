This doc has rough notes on the architecture of the parser.  [How to Parse
Shell Like a Programming Language][parse-shell] (on the blog) covers some of
the same material and is more polished.

## Lexing

### List of Regex-Based Lexers

Oil uses regex-based lexers, which are turned into efficient C code with
[re2c]($xref).  We intentionally avoid hand-written code that manipulates
strings char-by-char, since that strategy is error prone; it's inevitable that
rare cases will be mishandled.

The list of lexers can be found by looking at [native/fastlex.c]($oil-src).

- The large, modal OSH/Oil lexer in [frontend/lexer_def.py]($oil-src).
- Lexers for OSH sublanguages
  - For `echo -e`
  - For `PS1` backslash escapes.
  - For history expansion, e.g. `!$`.
  - For globs, to implement `${x/foo*/replace}` via conversion to ERE.  We need
    position information, and the `fnmatch()` API doesn't provide it, but
    `regexec()` does.
    - NOTE: We'll also need one for converting extended globs to EREs, for
      portability.

### Sublanguages We Don't Lex or Parse

These constructs aren't recognized by Oil's front end.  Instead, they're punted
to [libc]($xref):

- Glob patterns, e.g. `*.py` (in most cases)
- Extended glob patterns, e.g. `@(*.py|*.sh)`
- `strftime` format strings, e.g. `printf '%(%Y-%m-%d)T' $timestamp`

### Lexer Unread

[osh/word_parse.py]($oil-src) calls `lexer.MaybeUnreadOne()` to handle right
parens in this case:

```
(case x in x) ;; esac )
```

This is sort of like the `ungetc()` I've seen in other shell lexers.

## Parsing Issues

This section is about extra passes ("irregularities") at **parse time**.  In
the "Runtime Issues" section below, we discuss cases that involve parsing after
variable expansion, etc.

### Where We Parse More Than Once (statically, and unfortunately)

This makes it harder to produce good error messages with source location info.
It also implications for translation, because we break the "arena invariant".

(1) **Array L-values** like `a[x+1]=foo`.  bash allows splitting arithmetic
expressions across word boundaries: `a[x + 1]=foo`.  But I don't see this used,
and it would significantly complicate the OSH parser.

(in `_MakeAssignPair` in `osh/cmd_parse.py`)

(2) **Backticks**.  There is an extra level of backslash quoting that may
happen compared with `$()`.

(in `_ReadCommandSubPart` in `osh/word_parse.py`)

### Where We Read More Than Once (`VirtualLineReader`)

- [Here documents]($xref:here-doc):  We first read lines, and then parse them.
- [alias]($help) expansion

### Extra Passes Over the LST

These are handled up front, but not in a single pass.

- Assignment vs. Env binding detection: `FOO=bar declare a[x]=1`.
  We make another pass with `_SplitSimpleCommandPrefix()`.
  - Related: `s=1` doesn't cause reparsing, but `a[x+1]=y` does.
- Brace Detection in a few places: `echo {a,b}`
- Tilde Detection: `echo ~bob`, `home=~bob`

### Lookahead in Recursive Descent Parsers

- `myfunc() { echo hi; }` vs.  `myfunc=()  # an array`
- `shopt -s parse_equals`: For `x = 1 + 2*3`

### Where the Arena Invariant is Broken

- Here docs with `<<-`.  The leading tab is lost, because we don't need it for
  translation.

### Where Parsers are Instantiated

- See [frontend/parse_lib.py]($oil-src) and its callers.

## Runtime Parsing

### Where OSH Dynamically Parses

1. **Alias expansion** like `alias foo='ls | wc -l'`.  Aliases are like
"lexical macros".
2. **Prompt strings**.  `$PS1` and family first undergo `\` substitution, and
then the resulting strings are parsed as words, with `$` escaped to `\$`.
3. **Builtins**.
   - `eval` 
   - `trap` builtin
     - exit
     - debug
     - err
     - signals
   - `source` â€” the filename is formed dynamically, but the code is generally
     static.

### Where Bash Dynamically Parses (perhaps unintentionally)

All of the cases above, plus:

(1) Recursive **Arithmetic Evaluation**:

```sh-prompt
$ a='1+2'
$ b='a+3'
$ echo $(( b ))
6
```

This also happens for the operands to `[[ x -eq x ]]`.

Note that `a='$(echo 3)'` results in a **syntax error**.  I believe this was
due to the ShellShock mitigation.

(2) The **`unset` builtin** takes an LValue.  (not yet implemented in OSH)

```sh-prompt
$ a=(1 2 3 4)
$ expr='a[1+1]'
$ unset "$expr"
$ argv "${a[@]}"
['1', '2', '4']
```

(3) **printf -v** takes an "LValue".

(4) **Var refs** with `${!x}` takes a "cell".  (not yet implemented OSH.
Relied on by `bash-completion`, as discovered by Greg Price)

```sh-prompt
$ a=(1 2 3 4)
$ expr='a[$(echo 2 | tee BAD)]'
$ echo ${!expr}
3
$ cat BAD
2
```

(5) **test -v** takes a "cell".

(6) ShellShock (removed from bash): `export -f`, all variables were checked for
a certain pattern.

### Parse Errors at Runtime (Need Line Numbers)

- `test` / `[`, e.g. `[ -a -a -a ]`
- Command line flag usage errors
- [alias]($help) parse errors
